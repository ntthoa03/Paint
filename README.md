**1. Dynamically load all graphic objects that can be drawn from external DLL files.**

**2. The user can choose which object to draw.**

**3. The user can see the preview of the object they want to draw.**

**4. The user can finish the drawing preview and their change becomes permanent with previously drawn objects.**

**5. The list of drawn objects can be saved and loaded again for continuing later in self-defined binary format**

**6. Save and load all drawn objects as an image in bmp/png/jpg format (rasterization).**

### `Improvements`
